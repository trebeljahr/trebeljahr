# 👋 Hi there

I am Rico, a very curious human. There are many, many things I enjoy. Among them are coding, photography, science, reading, sports, traveling and playing the piano.

## 👨‍💻 What I do

You can find my personal website over at [trebeljahr.com](https://trebeljahr.com). It also has a [/now](https://trebeljahr.com/now) section. 

Currently I am doing monthly projects - the idea is to spend one month, pursuing a single idea and try to make it real (and push myself to see how far I can get, within a month).

You can see the progress over at [my 1-month projects site.](https://trebeljahr.com/1-month-projects)

## 📖 What I learn

I am always learning new things. 

Currently it is reading [The Feynman Lectures on Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/index.html) and watching [Steve Bruntons lectures on PDE's and Vector Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNQromC4WswpU1krLOq5Ro6S). 

## ✨ Something I am proud of

In the past I've compiled a list of things I love from the internet. You can find it over here: [trebeljahr.com/needlestack](https://trebeljahr.com/needlestack). It took a lot of work, but I think, it contains a lot of awesomeness.
